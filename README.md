# Hey, I'm Pallavi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer in the crypto space, diving deep into cryptography, blockchain, and decentralized tech. Right now, Iâ€™m all about learning the core technologies behind decentralized systems and exploring the inner workings of the crypto world

### Key Projects Iâ€™ve Worked On Recently! : 
- **[ERC20 Tokens]**: Developed custom ERC20 tokens, both [with](https://github.com/pallavi240303/erc20-nebula-token) and [without](https://github.com/pallavi240303/RusticToken-without-openzeppelin) the OpenZeppelin library.
- **[WebAuthn Integration](https://github.com/pallavi240303/webauthn_rust)**: Integrated passkey authentication into a Rust-based backend for a polling application.
- **[Thorchain API Fetcher](https://github.com/pallavi240303/thorchain-api-fetcher-mulitpleDB)**: Built a flexible API fetcher with multi-database support, utilizing a modular config structure.
- **[Crypto Algorithms](https://github.com/pallavi240303/shamir_secretsharing)**: Implemented Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing and Verifiable Secret Sharing algorithms to enhance security and privacy.

### What Iâ€™m focusing on these days:
- Designing decentralized applications with an emphasis on security and scalability.
- Deep diving into cryptographic protocols to build more robust and secure solutions.
- Crafting clean, modular architectures that are easy to scale and maintain.
